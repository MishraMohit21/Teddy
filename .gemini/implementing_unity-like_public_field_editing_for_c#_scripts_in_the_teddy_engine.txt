This conversation focuses on implementing Unity-like public field editing for C# scripts directly within the Teddy Engine's editor UI.

Key steps and issues encountered:
- Initial implementation of C# `[ShowInEditor]` attribute and C++ backend for field access.
- UI implementation in `SceneHierarchyPanel.cpp` for `float` fields.
- **Issue:** `[ShowInEditor]` attribute was initially applied to C# properties, but the attribute was only valid for fields. This was corrected by changing properties back to fields in `Player.cs`.
- **Issue:** Fields were still not appearing in the UI. Debugging revealed that the C++ reflection code in `ScriptingEngine.cpp` was not checking for the `[ShowInEditor]` attribute. This was fixed by adding `mono_custom_attrs_has_attr` check.
- Current status: Still debugging why fields are not appearing in the UI after the C++ reflection fix. Next step is to add logging to the UI panel to trace the issue.
